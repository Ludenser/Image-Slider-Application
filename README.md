# Image Slider Application

## Overview
The Image Slider Application is a React-based project that showcases a dynamic and responsive image gallery. It leverages the power of the Swiper library for a smooth and intuitive sliding experience and utilizes Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. This application features an interactive image slider with the capability to load additional images from an API, modal image viewing, and responsive design for optimal display across various devices.

## Features
- **Dynamic Image Loading with RTK Query**: Fetches images dynamically from an API using RTK Query, allowing for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
- **Modal View**: Clicking on an active slide opens the image in a modal window for closer inspection, enhancing user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implements lazy loading of images, improving performance and user experience by loading images as they are needed.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Supports loading more images as the user reaches the end of the slider, creating an endless scrolling experience.

## Technology Stack
- **React**: Used for building the user interface in a declarative and efficient way.
- **Swiper**: Utilized for the slider functionality, providing a robust and flexible solution for slideshows.
- **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**: Simplifies data fetching, caching, and state management, seamlessly integrating with the Redux ecosystem.
- **TypeScript**: Offers type safety and enhances development experience by catching errors early.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling, enabling more structured and maintainable CSS.
